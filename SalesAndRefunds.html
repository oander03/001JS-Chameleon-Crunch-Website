<p>
Thanks for shopping at Chameleon. We appreciate the fact that you like to buy the cool stuff we build. We also want to make sure you have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring, evaluating, and purchasing our products, whether you’re at the Chameleon Online Store for Education, in an Chameleon Retail Store, or on the phone with the Chameleon Contact Center. (To make it visually easier on both of us, we’ll refer to these entities as the “Chameleon Store” in this policy.) As with any shopping experience, there are terms and conditions that apply to transactions at an Chameleon Store. We’ll be as brief as our lawyers will allow. The main thing to remember is that by placing an order or making a purchase at an Chameleon Store, you agree to the terms set forth below along with Chameleon’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.        </p>

<h2>
Returns
        </h2>
        
<p>
We fundamentally believe you will be thrilled with the products you purchase from the Chameleon Store. That’s because we go out of our way to ensure that they’re designed and built to be just what you need. We understand, however, that sometimes a product may not be what you expected it to be. In that unlikely event, we invite you to review the following terms related to returning a product.
        </p>
<p>        
For iPhone returns, you may return your undamaged iPhone with its included accessories within 15 days of purchase for a full refund. Here’s the important part: returning your iPhone may not automatically cancel or reset your wireless account; you are responsible for your wireless service agreement and for any applicable fees associated with your wireless account. Please contact your provider for more information.
        </p>
   <p>        
For any other product, simply return it with the original receipt and original packaging within 14 days of the date you receive the product. If the item is returned within this timeframe, we’ll exchange it or offer a refund based upon the original payment method. For returns to an Chameleon Retail Store for cash, cash equivalent, and cheque transactions over $750, Chameleon will mail a refund cheque to you within 10 business days.
        </p>
        
        <h2>
Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections        </h2>
        
<p>
With regards to pricing, Chameleon reserves the right to change prices for products displayed at/on the Chameleon Store at any time, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. Additional information about pricing and sales tax is available on the Payment and Pricing page. In the event you have been charged more than the posted price for a product in an Chameleon Retail Store, please see a Manager for a refund of the overcharge.

        </p>
<p>        
Should Chameleon reduce its price on any Chameleon-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel free to visit an Chameleon Retail Store or contact the Chameleon Contact Center at 1-800-676-2775 to request a refund or credit of the difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit you must contact Chameleon within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events (such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Thrifty Thursday… okay, we made that last one up).
        </p>
   <p>        
Prices shown are in Canadian dollars. If you are paying for your order with an international Visa, MasterCard, or American Express credit card, please note that the purchase price may fluctuate with exchange rates. In addition, your bank or credit card issuer may also charge you foreign conversion charges and fees, which may also increase the overall cost of your purchase. Please contact your bank or credit card issuer regarding these fees.


        </p>

        Order Acceptance/Confirmation For Online and Call Center Purchases
        </h2>  
        
        
        <p>
Once we receive your order, we’ll provide you with an email order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation, however, does not signify Chameleon’s acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. The Chameleon Store reserves the right at any time after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. If Chameleon cancels an order after you have already been billed, Chameleon will refund the billed amount.

        </p>

        Shipping and Delivery
        </h2>
<p>        
Please review the Shipping and Delivery page to learn about how and when you will receive the products you purchased from the Chameleon Store. Since the actual delivery of your order can be impacted by many events beyond Chameleon’s control once it leaves our facilities, Chameleon cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth delivery.



        </p>
   <p>        
As Chameleon takes care of the dispatch of the products you purchase on the Chameleon Store, the risk of loss of, or damage to, product(s) shall pass to you when you, or a person designated by you, acquires physical possession of the product(s). Title in the product(s) shall pass to you when the product(s) is picked up by the carrier from our warehouse. At this point, you will receive the Shipment Notification Email. If there are any issues with delivery, please contact Chameleon to resolve.

        In-Store Pickup and Return

        </h2>
<p>
Chameleon offers in-store pickup for many of the items available on the Online Store. Certain products and payment methods, however, may not qualify for in-store pickup. Only you or the person designated by you may pick up the item(s) purchased. A government-issued photo ID and order number will be required for pickup. Chameleon will notify you when your order is ready and the date by which you need to pick up your items. We’ll also send you a reminder or two, just in case it slips your mind. If you don’t pick up your order, Chameleon may cancel it. Please visit Shipping and Pickup for complete details about in-store pickup.
